I'm Gergely Suba from Budapest, Hungary. I finished my BSc, MSc and PhD studies in Computer Engineering major at [BUTE](https://www.bme.hu/?language=en). 

Fields of my interests:
- model-based software development
- domain-specific languages (DSL)
- code generation
- high-level sythesis (HLS)
- Eclipse based tool development

I currently work at [Prolan Zrt.](https://www.prolan.hu/locale/en) as head of tool development department. Since 2017 we've built a hybrid-electronic railway interlocking system ([PRORIS](https://www.prolan.hu/en/products/PRORIS)) with 60 colleagues working on it. Our team implemented a DSL for railway interlocking algorithms, and another one to describe the static and dynamic (state machine) aspects of network protocols. 

The main technologies I've used in the last few years: Java 17, Eclipse, [EMF](https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/), [Xtext](https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/), [Xtend](https://www.eclipse.org/xtend/), [EMF Parsley](https://www.eclipse.org/emf-parsley/), [Graphiti](https://www.eclipse.org/graphiti/), [VIATRA](https://www.eclipse.org/viatra/), Spring, React, Maven, Jenkins.
